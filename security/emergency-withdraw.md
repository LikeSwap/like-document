If something happens to PantherSwap's frontend such as a DDOS attack or a temporary outage, farmers can still withdraw their tokens by direct interaction with the MasterChef contract.&#x20;

Call the emergencyWithdraw function with the farm or pool id listed below to withdraw your staked tokens. Withdraw without caring about rewards.&#x20;
